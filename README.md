# Simple js Game

A simple javascript game created using a js tutorial on W3schools as a fun learning exercise. I have plans for another more complex game, but needed something a little more digestable as a first project in js. 

The player controls a red square with the arrow keys and must dodge obstacles from the right side of the screen, as well as occasional "boss" obstacles from the top of the screen

## Features

This is a list of features not included in the W3 tutorial that I added myself once I was more comfortable with the language:
- Every 8-11 seconds an obstacle spawns from the top of the play area.
- Every boss obstacle after the first increases the difficulty 
- As difficulty increases, score multiplier goes up.
- Losing the game triggers a familiar sound
- music added
- A high score list that is displayed under the game canvas that is updated *todo*

## Legal(ish) Note

The legendary **MEGALOVANIA** is copyright of Toby Fox. I do not own it. I did not create it. I will (obviously) not be making any profit off this game, which is the only reason I am confortable using it. If by some *astronomically small* chance you're hearing it for the first time in this game, go buy Undertale. Seriously, it's great.
