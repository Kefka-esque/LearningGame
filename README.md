# Simple js Game

A simple javascript game created using a js tutorial on W3schools as a fun learning exercise. I have plans for another more complex game, but needed something a little more digestable as a first project in js. 

The player controls a red square with the arrow keys and must dodge obstacles from the right side of the screen, as well as occasional "boss" obstacles from the top of the screen

## Features

This is a list of features not included in the W3 tutorial that I added myself once I was more comfortable with the language:
- Every 10 seconds an obstacle spawns from the top of the play area. *Needs polish, almost finished. Plan is to change to a randomized timeframe*
- Every 20 seconds, the difficulty increases *To do*
- As difficulty increases, score multiplier goes up. *To do*
